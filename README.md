# Personal Portfolio
#### This is a simple landing page for a personal portfolio., 31.08.2021
#### By **Reuben Wachira Nguyo**
## Description
The personal portfolio landing page is a web page created using HTML and CSS, to display projects, contact list, a brief description of the portfolioâ€™s owner. It also include images of the projects and a brief summary on the same.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
To run the web page, it require little amount of effort because the only thing needed is to clone the project to your local host or download the zip and you can fully customize it to your liking, The same applies to uploading of the project, you just have to upload the project to your host server and it is live. However, in the project there is the use of Font awesome libraries and bootstrap, so make sure to check the version numbers in case there are missing icons or buttons when running the code.
## Known Bugs
Unfortunately my code has a few bugs. The most notable is that when refreshing the web page automatically scrolls down and the link for the social media buttons are not redirecting to the specified URL. Currently I am trying to solve the automatic scroll down on refresh as well as redirecting the social media buttons to the designated URL.
## Technologies Used
I have combined multiple grids in the social media section on the HTML code so that it multiples containers can be wrapped into one creating the displayed format of the social media buttons through bootstrap CSS file.
